One ultimate goal of visual neuroscience is to understand how the brain processes visual stimuli encountered in the natural environment. Achieving this goal requires records of brain responses under massive amounts of naturalistic stimuli. Although the scientific community has put in a lot of effort to collect large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data under naturalistic stimuli, more naturalistic fMRI datasets are still urgently needed. We present here the Natural Object Dataset (NOD), a large-scale fMRI dataset containing responses to 57,620 naturalistic images from 30 participants. NOD strives for a balance between sampling variation between individuals and sampling variation between stimuli. This enables NOD to be utilized not only for determining whether an observation is generalizable across many individuals, but also for testing whether a response pattern is generalized to a variety of naturalistic stimuli. We anticipate that the NOD together with existing naturalistic neuroimaging datasets will serve as a new impetus for our understanding of the visual processing of naturalistic stimuli.
